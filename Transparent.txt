How transparent is good governance?
The public institution will be able to make their people follow and understand the decision-making process 
by the way how they explain what has happened for the previous years to the present. They know that they are 
responsible to show how they will think of a way to make situations better. They will not make things complicated 
and they will just explain the way how people will see it clearly why they have made the decision instead. 
The people should be able to understand it the way how the public institution would want them to understand.
