How does good governance participate?
The people who are interested in the decision-making should be given the chance to participate in the process. 
They will be provided with the information needed in order for them to give opinions of how to improve. 
They will be able to contribute for them to understand each other and consider one’s recommendation. 
The local government will be able to participate with the people’s concerns.
