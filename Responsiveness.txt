How responsive is good governance?

The local government should be able to meet the needs of the entire community to be able to be of service to them. 
They should offer their help in order for the community to think positively against them and their environment. 
The community will also be able to help each other if the local government will be an example to them. 
People will follow their decisions if they will see it clearly that they are right and following them is better
 than other’s opinion. The local government should know or foresee what the community deserves.
